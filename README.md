## Miriam's coding journey...
"Learning to code is note just for coders". I believe every programmer is a self-taught programmer or if not had the most input in their programming journey and lifestyle because we cannot become better programmers without hard work from our side. In 2022 I got an admission to study Full-Stack Software Engineering in the best tech school in Nairobi Kenya under Scholarship program. It was a six months bootcamp and the program was in patnership with America's Flatiron bootcamp and so was the curriculum.

My background was Medical Biotechnology however, in April 2020 I started working for a Web Development Company as a Data Entry Specialist for products in the designed E-commerce Websites. I didn't know how to write code. I didnâ€™t have a clue that was how Software Engineering would be. While working for the web development company, I always wanted to know how to program & write code from scratch, I had finally gained admission into the field that interests me most. I started actualizing my dream as a programmer, but as a beginner, I found out that learning programming is hard. Itâ€™s difficult to know where to start and even more challenging to know what to do after you have learned the basics.

I knew nothing. All I knew was that I wanted to develop websites with deeper understanding of how code works. My first few months involved chaotic learning. I kept seeing information in different directions, from HTML to css to Javascript, React, Ruby & Ruby on Rails. I was getting frustrated. I decided to take it one step at a time. I decided to focus my energy and efforts on studying what I was planning to do for the rest of my life: programming, especially knowing that this is a gateway to what I have been wishing to do "Bioinformatics".

I studied, but I kept running into errors that frustrated me. I just had to stay calm, & focused, work hard, and be consistent. I recommend that everyone choose their path early and focus on it because you will definitely get there. Eventually I graduated. Programming has made me believe that I can solve a problem and tackle an error. My thinking has improved and continues to improve overtime. Code has given me a purpose in life. At times, it makes me frustrated that I missed a simple syntax error. At the same time, it makes me happy that Iâ€™m making progress.

Looking forward, I am eager to learn more, become a better programmer, and hit my first paid job as a programmer soon. I would like to tell everyone that becoming a programmer is not something you can learn by merely attending computer science classes.
Even if you have a computer science degree, you still have to:

* Be passionate about programming.
* Practice.
* Read books and watch presentations.
* Try different languages.
* Read and write code daily
* Type rather than read (always write on the topic for better understanding).
* Learn and implement.
* Write software that interests you.
* Aim to write the smallest working program possible.
* Always google.
* Build programs one at a time.
* Ensure braces always pair up.
* Format code correctly.

The embarrassment of an error lasts only for a few seconds. Learning from it can be forever, and trust me, it is worth it. Be consistent, CODE!
